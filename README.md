Week 2
Wrote the script in charge of the audio analysis. It extracts audio data and it calculates the frequency bands through Fast Fourier Transform. All the samples, chosen 512 and then split between 8 bands are then used to in the implementation of band buffers for a smoother motion (for audio visualisation).

Week 3
Added the calculation of the amplitude and experimented with the thresold, not very successful. Wrote a part of the script in charge of detecting the musical events.

Week 4-6
Refinement of the script in charge of beat detection. Started working on the game mechanics itself, spawn the object, interact with them, get some sort of response back. Wrote a method that saves the song data to a json that will be later used in order to build more accurate level, hopefully.
